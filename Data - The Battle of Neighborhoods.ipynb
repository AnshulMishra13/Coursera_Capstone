However, given the size of the project and for simplicity only the following scenario will be addressed:\n\n1. Query the FourSqaure website for the top sites in Detroit\n\n2. Use the FourSquare API to get supplemental geographical data about the top sites\n\n3. Use the FourSquare API to get top restaurent recommendations closest to each of the top site\n\n4. Use open source Detroit Crime data to provide the user with additional crime data",
